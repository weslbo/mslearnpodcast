# Introduction



Microsoft Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Whether your data is a simple Microsoft Excel workbook, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses, Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize (or discover) what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.

Power BI can be simple and fast, capable of creating quick insights from an Excel workbook or a local database. But Power BI is also robust and enterprise-grade, ready not only for extensive modeling and real-time analytics, but also for custom development. Therefore, it can be your personal report and visualization tool, but can also serve as the analytics and decision engine behind group projects, divisions, or entire corporations.
If you're a beginner with Power BI, this module will get you going. If you're a Power BI veteran, this module will tie concepts together and fill in the gaps.

# The parts of Power BI

Power BI consists of a Microsoft Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop, an online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service, and mobile Power BI apps that are available on any device, with native mobile BI apps for Windows, iOS, and Android.

These three elementsâDesktop, the service, and Mobile appsâare designed to let people create, share, and consume business insights in the way that serves them, or their role, most effectively.

# How Power BI matches your role

How you use Power BI might depend on your role on a project or a team. And other people, in other roles, might use Power BI differently, which is just fine.
For example, you might view reports and dashboards in the Power BI service, and that might be all you do with Power BI. But your number-crunching, business-report-creating coworker might make extensive use of Power BI Desktop (and publish Power BI Desktop reports to the Power BI service, which you then use to view them). And another coworker, in sales, might mainly use her Power BI phone app to monitor progress on her sales quotas and drill into new sales lead details.
You also might use each element of Power BI at different times, depending on what you're trying to achieve, or what your role is for a given project or effort.
Perhaps you view inventory and manufacturing progress in a real-time dashboard in the service, and also use Power BI Desktop to create reports for your own team about customer engagement statistics. How you use Power BI can depend on which feature or service of Power BI is the best tool for your situation. But each part of Power BI is available to you, which is why it's so flexible and compelling.
We discuss these three elementsâDesktop, the service, and Mobile appsâin more detail later. In upcoming units and modules, we'll also create reports in Power BI Desktop, share them in the service, and eventually drill into them on our mobile device.

# The flow of work in Power BI

A common flow of work in Power BI begins in Power BI Desktop, where a report is created. That report is then published to the Power BI service and finally shared, so that users of Power BI Mobile apps can consume the information.
It doesn't always happen that way, and that's okay. But we'll use that flow to help you learn the different parts of Power BI and how they complement each other.
Okay, now that we have an overview of this module, what Power BI is, and its three main elements, let's take a look at what it's like to use Power BI.

# Use Power BI



Now that we've introduced the basics of Microsoft Power BI, let's jump into some hands-on experiences and a guided tour.
The activities and analyses that you'll learn with Power BI generally follow a common flow. The common flow of activity looks like this:

- Bring data into Power BI Desktop, and create a report.
- Publish to the Power BI service, where you can create new visualizations or build dashboards.
- Share dashboards with others, especially people who are on the go.
- View and interact with shared dashboards and reports in Power BI Mobile apps.


As mentioned earlier, you might spend all your time in the Power BI service, viewing visuals and reports that have been created by others. And that's fine. Someone else on your team might spend their time in Power BI Desktop, which is fine too. To help you understand the full continuum of Power BI and what it can do, we'll show you all of it. Then you can decide how to use it to your best advantage.
So, let's jump in and step through the experience. Your first order of business is to learn the basic building blocks of Power BI, which will provide a solid basis for turning data into cool reports and visuals.

# Building blocks of Power BI



In Microsoft Power BI, there are basic building blocks that make up the reports and dashboards consumed by end users. Think of it similarly to the basic construction materials that can be used to build homes or other structures.
Here are the basic building blocks in Power BI:

- Reports consist of visualizations and semantic models created with Power BI Desktop application.
- Dashboards consist of tiles from report visualizations created in the online Power BI service.


# Visualizations

A visualization (or visual) is a visual representation of data, like a chart, a color-coded map, or other interesting things you can create to represent your data visually. Power BI has all sorts of visualization types, and more are coming all the time. The following image shows a collection of different visualizations that were created in Power BI.

Visualizations can be simple, like a single number that represents something significant. Visuals can also be complex, like a gradient-colored map that shows voter sentiment about a certain social issue or concern. The goal of a visual is to present data in a way that provides context and insights, both of which would probably be difficult to discern from a raw table of numbers or text.

# semantic models

A semantic model is a collection of data that Power BI uses to create its visualizations.
You can have a simple semantic model that's based on a single table from a Microsoft Excel workbook, similar to what's shown in the following image.

semantic models can also be a combination of many different sources, which you can filter and combine to provide a unique collection of data (a semantic model) for use in Power BI.
For example, you can create a semantic model from three database fields, one website table, an Excel table, and online results of an email marketing campaign. That unique combination is still considered a single semantic model, even though it was pulled together from many different sources.
Filtering data before bringing it into Power BI lets you focus on the data that matters to you. For example, you can filter your contact database so that only customers who received emails from the marketing campaign are included in the semantic model. You can then create visuals based on that subset (the filtered collection) of customers who were included in the campaign. Filtering helps you focus your dataâand your efforts.
You can create a Power BI report from almost any data, thanks to the many available data connectors, such as Excel, a Microsoft SQL Server database, Azure, Oracle, Facebook, Salesforce, and MailChimp.
After you have a semantic model, you can begin creating visualizations that show different portions of it in different ways, and gain insights based on what you see. That's where reports come in.

# Reports

In Power BI, a report is a collection of visualizations on one or more pages. As with other reports you've seen or created, Power BI reports combine related data. The following image shows a report in Power BI Desktopâin this case, it's the second page in a five-page report.

Reports let you create many visualizations, on multiple pages if necessary, and let you arrange those visualizations in whatever way best tells your story.
You might have a report about quarterly sales, product growth in a particular segment, or migration patterns of polar bears. Whatever your subject, reports let you gather and organize your visualizations onto one page (or more).

# Dashboards

When you're ready to share a report, or a collection of visualizations, you can create a Power BI dashboard. Much like the dashboard in a car, a dashboard is a selected group of visuals that provide quick and important insight into the data or story you're trying to present.
Dashboards are limited to a single page, and allow users to follow a visual to the underlying report. Users interact with dashboards through the Power BI service or on a mobile device.

# Tiles

In Power BI, a tile is a single visualization on a dashboard. It's the rectangular box that holds an individual visual. In the following image, you see one tile, which is also surrounded by other tiles.

When you're creating a dashboard in Power BI, you can move or arrange tiles however you want. You can make them bigger, change their height or width, and snuggle them up to other tiles.
When you're viewing, or consuming, a dashboard or reportâwhich means you're not the creator or owner, but the report or dashboard has been shared with youâyou can interact with it, but you can't change the size of the tiles or their arrangement.

# All together now

Let's review the building blocks of Power BI:

- Power BI Desktop lets you build semantic models and use visuals to make reports.
- The online Power BI service brings together reports, dashboards, and tools for easy distribution and management of your Power BI content.

Understanding the Power BI basics empowers you to create semantic models and design reports. Your reports don't have to be complex to be interesting and informative. Power BI offers easy ways to design reports from a single Excel sheet.
Power BI is also scalable, allowing you to create semantic models from various data sources, even incorporating custom code. The semantic model can then be used to design interactive reports and dashboards that emphasize crucial data for informed business decisions.
No matter how you use Power BI, it all starts with semantic models and visuals. These are the foundation for your reports that share insights and dashboards that present the most important data upfront.

# Tour and use the Power BI service



The common flow of work in Microsoft Power BI is to create a report in Power BI Desktop, publish it to the Power BI service, and then distribute to consumers to view through the service or mobile app.
Power BI service allows you to create apps for easy distribution and clutter-free consumption. An app is a way to group related reports and dashboards and distribute to the appropriate audience(s).
We go into more detail about apps (and the service) in upcoming modules, but let's walk through the experience to understand how apps benefit your organization.

# Explore built-in sample reports

Easily explore built-in samples to get familiar using the Power BI service. Built-in samples are each a bundle of one or more dashboards, semantic models, and reports that you can use with the Power BI service.
From the Power BI service, open the Learning center from the left navigation pane. Pick one of the available built-in samples, which opens in Reading mode. Power BI then imports the sample and adds a new report and semantic model to your My workspace.

After you've chosen a sample report, you can see the direct report sharing experience for consumers. Take note of the Power BI service navigation pane and header, as shown in the following screenshot. You can see the report navigation and the filter pane, both of which are collapsible.


# Explore template apps

Now that you understand how a report can be shared through Power BI service, let's look at the app experience. To replicate the experience, we're using the GitHub template app.


Tip
To access template apps, select the Apps icon from the left navigation pane > Get apps > Template apps.

In the following screenshot, you can see that the Power BI service left navigation pane and header that were visible with the direct report are gone. Also note the dashboard and a multi-page report in the app navigation pane. The app provides a cleaner look with only the relevant content. It's also customizable with app color and thumbnail. Apps also allow you to configure multiple audiences if you need to limit access to certain pages in a report, for instance.

All of the visuals are interactive and interacting with one visual filters the others accordingly. For example, when you select on mihart in the donut chart on the Top 100 Contributors report, all other visuals only show related data for mihart.


# Refresh data in the Power BI service

Likely, your data changes regularly, so Power BI accounts allows on-demand and scheduled semantic model refreshes. From the app workspace, you manually refresh or schedule up to eight refreshes per day at minimum.

Tip
For more information about all refresh schedules, see the Refresh data documentation.

The semantic models tab is selected on the Settings page that appears. In the right pane, select the arrow next to Scheduled refresh to expand that section. The Settings dialog box appears on the canvas, letting you set the update settings that meet your needs.

The Power BI service provides a simple and interactive user experience to take your data analytics to the next level.
