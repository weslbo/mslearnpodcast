  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
    Welcome to the Microsoft Learn Podcast, the show where we dive deep into the world of technology and explore the latest advancements. I'm your host, Brian, and today we have a special guest joining us. Andrew, why don't you introduce yourself?
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">
    Thanks, Brian. I'm Andrew, and I work for Contoso. I specialize in data modeling and analysis using Microsoft Power BI.
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
    Great to have you here, Andrew. Today, we're going to talk about implicit measures in Power BI. Can you explain what implicit measures are?
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">
    Certainly, Brian. Implicit measures are automatic behaviors in Power BI that allow visuals to summarize column data in a model. When a column is shown with the sigma symbol in the Fields pane, it indicates that it's a numeric column that will be summarized when used in a visual.
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
    Ah, I see. So, as a data modeler, you have control over how a column summarizes by setting the Summarization property. Can you explain how that works?
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">
    Absolutely. By setting the Summarization property, you can determine if and how a column summarizes. You can choose to set it to "Don't summarize" or to a specific aggregation function like sum, average, minimum, maximum, count, and more. When you set it to "Don't summarize," the sigma symbol will no longer show next to the column in the Fields pane.
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
    That's interesting. So, how can report authors use implicit measures in Power BI?
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">
    To observe how report authors can use implicit measures, they can download and open the Adventure Works DW 2020 M04.pbix file. In the report, they can add a numeric field to a visual, and then review the context menu options to see how the column is summarized. They can choose different aggregation functions to suit their visual requirements.
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
    Ah, I see. So, implicit measures provide flexibility for report authors to customize the summarization technique. What are the benefits of using implicit measures?
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">
    There are several benefits to using implicit measures. First, they are simple to learn and use. Report authors don't have to create explicit calculations, which saves time and effort. Second, they provide flexibility in visualizing model data, allowing report authors to choose the most suitable summarization technique for their visuals.
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
    That's great. Implicit measures seem to offer a lot of advantages. Are there any limitations to using them?
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">
    Yes, there are some limitations to implicit measures. One limitation is that report authors could choose to aggregate a column in unsuitable ways, leading to misleading data. Another limitation is that implicit measures only work for simple scenarios and specific aggregation functions. For more complex requirements, explicit measures using DAX formulas are needed. Lastly, implicit measures don't work when the model is queried using Multidimensional Expressions (MDX).
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
    I see. So, there are some scenarios where explicit measures are necessary. Can you explain how to create simple measures using DAX formulas?
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">
    Certainly, Brian. To create a simple measure, you can write a DAX formula that aggregates the values of a single column. For example, you can use the SUM function to sum the values of a numeric column. After creating the measure, you can set the formatting options to ensure well-presented values in all report visuals.
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
    That's a great explanation, Andrew. So, measures are used at query time to return summarizations of model data. How do they differ from calculated columns?
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">
    Calculated columns and measures are both calculations that can be added to a semantic model. However, they differ in their purpose, evaluation, storage, and visual use. Calculated columns extend a table with a new column and are evaluated at data refresh time using row context. Measures, on the other hand, define how to summarize model data and are evaluated at query time using filter context. Calculated columns store values in the model, while measures do not. Additionally, calculated columns can be used for filtering, grouping, and summarizing, while measures are designed specifically for summarization.
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
    That's a clear distinction between calculated columns and measures. Can you explain how compound measures work?
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">
    Certainly, Brian. A compound measure is a measure that references one or more measures. It allows you to perform calculations based on existing measures. For example, you can create a compound measure to calculate profit by subtracting the cost from the revenue. This allows you to build more complex calculations using the measures you have already created.
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
    That's a powerful feature. So, Power BI also includes a feature called Quick Measures. Can you explain how it works?
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">
    Of course. Quick Measures is a feature in Power BI Desktop that helps you quickly perform common calculations by generating the DAX expression for you. It provides a range of categories and options to fit your needs. You can see the generated DAX expression and use it to expand your DAX knowledge. It's a great tool for accelerating your calculations and learning DAX.
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
    That sounds like a time-saving feature. So, Andrew, what are some final thoughts on implicit measures in Power BI?
  </voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">
    In conclusion, implicit measures provide a simple and flexible way for report authors to summarize model data in Power BI. They offer benefits such as ease of use and customization options. However, they do have limitations and may not be suitable for complex scenarios. In such cases, explicit measures using DAX formulas are necessary. It's important for data modelers and report authors to understand the strengths and limitations of implicit measures to make the most out of Power BI.
