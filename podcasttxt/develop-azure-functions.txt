  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">Welcome to the Microsoft Learn Podcast! I'm your host, Brian, and today we have a special guest joining us. Andrew, why don't you introduce yourself?</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">Thanks, Brian! I'm Andrew, and I work for Contoso. I'm excited to be here and talk about Azure Functions development.</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">Great to have you, Andrew! So let's dive right in. Functions consist of two main components - your code and the function.json file. Can you explain how these two pieces work together?</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">Certainly, Brian. The code is where you write your function logic, and it can be written in various languages. The function.json file, on the other hand, defines the function's trigger, bindings, and other configuration settings. It tells the runtime how to pass data into and return data from the function.</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">That makes sense. So the function.json file contains the configuration for triggers and bindings. Can you explain what triggers and bindings are?</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">Absolutely. Triggers are what cause a function to run. They define how a function is invoked and a function must have exactly one trigger. Bindings, on the other hand, connect other resources to the function. They can be used as input bindings, output bindings, or both. Bindings provide data to the function as parameters.</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">I see. So triggers and bindings allow us to connect our function to other services. Can you give us an example of how this works?</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">Sure, Brian. Let's say we want to write a new row to Azure Table storage whenever a new message appears in Azure Queue storage. We can use an Azure Queue storage trigger and an Azure Table storage output binding. The function.json file would define these bindings and their respective properties, such as the queue name and connection string.</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">That's a great example, Andrew. Now, let's talk about function apps. What exactly is a function app?</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">A function app provides an execution context in Azure for your functions to run. It's the unit of deployment and management for your functions. A function app can contain multiple individual functions that are managed, deployed, and scaled together. It's a way to organize and collectively manage your functions.</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">Got it. So a function app is like a container for our functions. Now, let's talk about the folder structure. How is the code organized within a function app?</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">The code for all the functions in a function app is located in a root project folder. This folder contains a host configuration file called host.json, which contains runtime-specific configurations. There's also a bin folder that contains packages and other library files required by the function app. The specific folder structure depends on the language you're using.</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">That's helpful to know, Andrew. Now, let's shift gears and talk about local development environments. How can we develop and test functions on our local computers?</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">Functions make it easy to use your favorite code editor and development tools for local development. You can connect your local functions to live Azure services and even debug them using the full Functions runtime. The development process depends on your language and tooling preferences, but you can find more information on how to code and test Azure Functions locally in the documentation.</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">That's great, Andrew. It's always helpful to be able to develop and test locally before deploying to Azure. Now, let's discuss connecting functions to Azure services. How do we reference connection information in our function projects?</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">In your function project, you reference connection information by name from its configuration provider. You don't directly provide the connection details, allowing them to be changed across environments. For example, you can use environment variables to store connection strings and reference them by name in your function code.</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">That's a smart approach, Andrew. It allows for flexibility and easy configuration across different environments. Now, let's talk about identity-based connections. How are these configured in Azure Functions?</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">Identity-based connections in Azure Functions use a managed identity when hosted in the Azure Functions service. The system-assigned identity is used by default, but you can also specify a user-assigned identity. The identity must have the necessary permissions to perform the intended actions, which can be assigned through Azure RBAC or access policies.</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">That's important to keep in mind, Andrew. Permissions must be granted to the identity to ensure it can perform the required actions. Now, let's move on to the exercise. In this exercise, we'll create an Azure Function using Visual Studio Code. Can you walk us through the steps?</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">Of course, Brian. In this exercise, we'll create a C# function that responds to HTTP requests. We'll start by creating a local project in Visual Studio Code, then run the function locally to test it. After that, we'll sign in to Azure, create the necessary resources, and finally deploy the function code to Azure. The exercise provides step-by-step instructions on how to complete each task.</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">That sounds like a hands-on exercise that will give our listeners some practical experience. Now, let's wrap up this episode. Andrew, do you have any final thoughts or tips for our listeners?</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-AndrewNeural">Absolutely, Brian. My tip would be to start small and experiment with Azure Functions. They offer a flexible and scalable way to build serverless applications. Take advantage of the local development environment to iterate quickly and test your functions before deploying to Azure. And don't forget to explore the documentation for more in-depth examples and guidance.</voice>
  <voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">Those are great tips, Andrew. Thank you for joining us today and sharing your insights on Azure Functions development. And thank you to our listeners for tuning in to the Microsoft Learn Podcast. We hope you found this episode informative and helpful. Stay tuned for more exciting topics in the world of Microsoft Learn. Until next time, happy learning!</voice>
